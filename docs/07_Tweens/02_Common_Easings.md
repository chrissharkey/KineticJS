#HTML5 Canvas Simple Easings with KineticJS

To create a non linear easing tween with KineticJS, we can set the `easing`
property to an easing function.  Other than `Kinetic.Easings.Linear`,
the other most common easings are `Kinetic.Easings.EaseIn`,
`Kinetic.Easings.EaseInOut`, and `Kinetic.Easings.EaseOut`.

For all available easings go to [Easings Documentation](http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/api/Kinetic.Easing.html).

Instructions: Mouseover or touchstart the boxes to tween them with different easing functions
