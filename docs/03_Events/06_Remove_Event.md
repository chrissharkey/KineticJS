#HTML5 Canvas Remove Event Listener with KineticJS

To remove an event listener with KineticJS, we can use the `off()` method of
a shape object which requires an event type such as click or mousedown.

Instructions: Click on the circle to see an alert triggered from the onclick
event binding.  Remove the event listener by clicking on the button and again
click on the circle to observe that the event binding has been removed.
