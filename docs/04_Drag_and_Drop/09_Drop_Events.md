#HTML5 Canvas Drop Events with KineticJS

KineticJS does not support drop events. But you can write your own drop events detections.
To detect drop target shape you have to move dragging object into another layer.

In this example you can see implementation of `drop`, `dragenter`, `dragleave`, `dragover` events.
