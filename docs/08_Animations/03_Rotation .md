#HTML5 Canvas KineticJS Rotation Animation Tutorial

To animate a shape's rotation with KineticJS, we can create a new animation with
`Kinetic.Animation`, and define a function which modifies the shape's rotation with each animation frame.

In this tutorial, we'll rotate a blue rectangle about the top left corner,
a yellow rectangle about its center, and a red rectangle about an outside point.

For a full list of attributes and methods, check out the [Kinetic.Animation documentation](http://lavrton.github.io/KineticJS/api/Kinetic.Animation.html).
