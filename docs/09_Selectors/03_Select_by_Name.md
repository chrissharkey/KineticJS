#HTML5 Canvas Select Shapes by Name with KineticJS

To select shapes by name with KineticJS, we can use the `find()` method using the `.` selector.
The `find()` method returns an array of nodes that match the selector string.
The return array is a `Kinetic.Collection` array, which is basically a typical JavaScript array with a special `each()` method.
The `each()` method enables us to quickly iterate through every node in the array.
