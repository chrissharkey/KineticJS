#HTML5 Canvas KineticJS Custom Hit Function Tutorial

To create a custom hit draw function for a shape with KineticJS, we can set
the `drawHitFunc` property.  A hit draw function is the function that KineticJS
will use to draw a region used for hit detection.  Using a custom draw hit
function can have several benefits, such as making the hit region larger
so that it's easier for users to interact with a shape, making some portions
of a shape detectable and others not, or simplifying the hit draw function
in order to improve rendering performance.

Instructions: Mouseover, mouseout, mousedown, and mouseup over the star and
observe that the hit region is an over sized circle encompassing the shape.
