#HTML5 Canvas Save Stage as JSON String with KineticJS

To save the stage as a JSON string with KineticJS, we can use the `toJSON()`
method which serializes the KineticJS Node tree into text which can be saved
in web storage or in an offline database. We can also serialize other nodes,
including layers, groups, and shapes.
